## About Me
I've long been fascinated by how AI can be used to solve real business problems by changing how you use tools and which strategies and frameworks you adopt.
That's what I'm trying to do at Andersen in Rwanda, where I'm building out our AI Advisory practice. We help companies figure out if they're ready for AI, then build the actual frameworks and tools to help them get there faster - everything from automating research to creating market intelligence systems.

In my free time, I'm trying to solve the education problem around how schools, mentors and students approach mentoring. Career choice is something that every student and graduate faces and many wonder how do I choose a career that is both fulfilling and societally transformational that will truly make an impact in my lifetime and I think it's something worth spending time on to try and help students make such choices.

Other than that, I like podcasts and listen to at least 1.5 audiobooks per week.
